<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a resident of the United States (including its possessions and territories), you agree to the Arbitration Agreement and class action waiver described in Section 15 to resolve any disputes with PetBox, its affiliates and their respective, officers, directors and employees (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that by using this Site and registering for any of the Services, you are at least 18 years of age, or visiting under the supervision of a parent or guardian, and legally able to enter into a contract.</span></p>
<p><b>If you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, do not access and/or use the Site or Services.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PetBox may, from time to time, change these Terms of Use, including the Privacy Policy. Such revisions shall be effective immediately, provided that any changes to pricing will not take effect until your next purchase.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PRIVACY</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally identifying information is subject to our Privacy Policy (</span><a href="../privacy-policy-2/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PetBox.com/privacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) the terms of which are incorporated herein. Please review the Privacy Policy before using the Service as it governs our treatment of any information. Please note that certain information, statements, data, and content (such as photographs) which you may submit to PetBox are likely to reveal your gender, ethnic origin, nationality, age, and/or other personal information about you. You acknowledge that your submission of any information, statements, data, and content to us is voluntary on your part and that PetBox may process and use such information, within the terms of the Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ACCOUNTS</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By signing up for the Service, you are becoming an ongoing subscriber or member of the Service and agreeing to pay PetBox the then applicable monthly membership fee or subscription cost, as applicable. Your PetBox membership and/or subscription, either of which may start with a free trial, will continue month-to-month at the standard non-discounted rate unless and until you cancel the applicable Service or we terminate it. You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, &#8220;Payment Method&#8221;) to use the Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each month, we will bill the monthly membership fee or subscription cost, as applicable, to the Payment Method on the day of the month you first joined. You must cancel your membership or subscription, as applicable, before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month&#8217;s membership/subscription fees to your Payment Method. </span><b>Annual memberships will be billed on the anniversary date of enrollment.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment of membership fees earns you credit towards a future purchase of goods from PetBox. Except as may be described in the specific terms of an enrollment offer which you agree to at the time of enrollment, credits expire twelve (12) months from issuance. Your card will also be charged for any products ordered and the cost of shipping (less any applicable discounts and credits).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may offer a number of membership and subscription plans, including special promotional plans or memberships with differing conditions and limitations. Any terms that are materially different from those described in these Terms of Use will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your membership/subscription by visiting our website and clicking on the [&#8220;Account Settings&#8221;] link. Some promotional memberships/subscriptions may be offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered membership plans at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you subscribe to a prepaid multi-box plan, you may pause deliveries at any time in the My Subscription section on the Site. Under a prepaid plan, you may not change the frequency of delivery until the prepaid period expires. Prepaid plans automatically renew unless you cancel, which you may do at anytime as described below. If you cancel prior to receiving all of the boxes for which you prepaid, you may elect to receive a refund of the remaining amount of the prepayment. To cancel and request a refund, please contact Customer Service. To become a member/subscriber, you must register for an account with us (“</span><b>Company Account</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the Site registration form. In creating an account, you represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is complete, truthful and accurate and (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information as such may change from time to time. You may (i) have only one active account per household and (ii) not participate in a discounted or initial promotional offer more than once during any ninety (90) day period (Note: you may receive one or more discounts for referring new members as described in such offers and you may receive a waiver of certain membership fees if you rejoin after having previously terminated your membership). Company may suspend or terminate your Company Account in Company’s discretion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Company Account login information.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> REFERRALS</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When qualified friends you invite to become members of PetBox make their first payment for products, you will receive a Referral Credit of up to $20. The specific amount of the Referral Credit may vary from time to time and will be specified on the particular offer. Your friend must be a new member of PetBox (i.e., they cannot have previously been a PetBox subscriber or received free or discounted products from PetBox) and live in a different household (with a different shipping address) in the United States. By providing the name and/or email address of a third party to PetBox in connection with the referral process, you hereby authorize PetBox to send emails on your behalf to any email address you submit in that process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will only receive a Referral Credit for your friend&#8217;s first qualified purchase if the purchase was a result of an invite from you via an authorized referral method. If your friend does not click on the personal referral link in their invite email or other invite mechanism to accept your invitation, you will not receive a Referral Credit and we will have no liability to you because there is no discernible way to identify that the purchase resulted from your referral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A qualified purchase is considered a PetBox subscription or membership. Free or discounted trial orders do not count as a qualified purchase. While there is no limit to the amount of referrals you can make, you may only earn up to $100 in total Referral Credits. You can track your Referral Credits by visiting the Invites section in your Profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If two people refer the same friend, the friend who sent the link that is used to create the new member&#8217;s account will be considered the referring friend, regardless of which link was sent to the new member first. There is a limit of one Referral Credit per new email address that is registered on PetBox.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not use spam or send unsolicited emails to people you don&#8217;t personally know to collect Referral Credits and you may not collect Referral Credits by posting on message boards or other online venues in violation of such venues&#8217; terms of use. PetBox may terminate your account and/or rescind all your existing Referral Credits if you violate this policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except as may be described otherwise in the terms of your sign up offer, Referral Credits are valid for twelve (12) months from issuance. Your Referral Credits are automatically applied to your purchases at checkout in the order in which they expire (i.e., first to expire will be applied first). You can check the amount of Referral Credits you have earned and their associated expiration dates at any time by visiting the Invites section in your Profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Referral Credits are issued to an individual PetBox account holder at our discretion and cannot be transferred between accounts or between users. Credits cannot be bartered, exchanged or sold. Corporate customers are not eligible to participate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Referral Credits are a promotional offer and are not a payment instrument. Referral Credits are issued without any exchange of money or value from you and you have no vested property right or interest in them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Referral Credits have no cash value by themselves; they are only deemed to have a notional cash value if they are used in connection with an eligible purchase on PetBox.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to limit or cancel your Referral Credits in our sole discretion if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Service, including without limitation through fraudulent or misleading referral activity (for example, by inviting fake people to join PetBox, using false names, using multiple email accounts or email addresses, impersonating another person or otherwise providing false or misleading information to us) or if we terminate your account for any reason. You may also be liable for civil and/or criminal penalties under applicable law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right in our sole discretion at any time and without prior notice to you, to add to, remove or otherwise change the terms applicable to the issuance and use of Referral Credits. Such changes may include, without limitation, how you may earn and spend Referral Credits, how long Referral Credits last, minimum purchase amounts with which Referral Credits may be used and the lifetime maximum amount of Referral Credits that you may earn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IN NO EVENT SHALL WE (AND OUR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO COMPANY PRODUCTS, THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE OR SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE PRODUCTS AND/OR THIS AGREEMENT (FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) SIXTY US DOLLARS ($60) OR (B) AMOUNTS YOU’VE PAID COMPANY IN THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS (IF ANY). THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT. YOU AGREE THAT OUR SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU. If any provision or provisions of these Terms of Use shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="13">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TERMS AND TERMINATION</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subject to this Section, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Site or Services. We may (a) suspend your rights to use the Site and/or Services (including your Company Account) or (b) terminate this Agreement, at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the Site or Services in violation of this Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, your Company Account and right to access and use the Site and Services will terminate immediately. You understand that any termination of your Company Account involves deletion of your User Content associated therewith from our live databases. Company will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of this Agreement, including for termination of your Company Account or deletion of your User Content. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if Company terminates this Agreement other than due to your violation of this Agreement or discontinues the Service, Company will provide you a pro-rata refund of your last payment for any pre-paid but unused Services (if applicable). Even after this Agreement is terminated, the following provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect: Sections 2 and 4 through 14 (in each case inclusive of all subsections).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="14">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DISPUTE RESOLUTION. PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>(a)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and the company and our employees, agents, successors, or assigns, regarding or relating to the Site, Services or this Agreement, shall exclusively be settled through binding arbitration in New Jersey. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or we may bring an individual action in small claims court.</span></p>
<p><b>(b)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (&#8220;</span><b>AAA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;). As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA&#8217;s final rules for commercial arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the procedures for consumer-related disputes.</span></p>
<p><b>(c)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</span></p>
<p><b>(d)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You and we must abide by the following rules (1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES&#8217; INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#8217;S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (4) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; and (5) the arbitrator&#8217;s award shall be final and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><b>(e)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) in Section 14d above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subparts (1) and (2) in Section 14d (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration. If a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration because the agreement to arbitrate is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><b>(f)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if we seek to terminate the Dispute Resolution section as included in the Agreement, any such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of the Agreement not containing the agreement to arbitrate is posted to the Site, and shall not be effective as to any claim of which you provided the Company with written notice prior to the date of termination.</span></p>
<p><b>(g)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at </span><a href="http://www.adr.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.adr.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="15">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MISCELLANEOUS</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Changes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Company reserves the right to make changes to the Site, Services, policies, and the terms of this Agreement at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition. All changes, except those that relate to pricing for existing customers, shall take effect immediately upon posting. Continued use of our Site or Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</span></p>
<p><b>Entire Agreement; Headings; No Assignment by You.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding our Products, the use of the Site and Services and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word including means including without limitation. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of a customer to the Company and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.</span></p>
<p><b>Governing Law.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and the Company and our employees, agents, successors, or assigns, regarding or relating to these the Site, Services or this Agreement, shall exclusively be governed by the internal laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to its choice of law rules and without regard to conflicts of laws principles except that the arbitration provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You may also be entitled to certain consumer protection rights under the laws of your local jurisdiction.</span></p>
